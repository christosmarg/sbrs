.It Fl t
Delete one of the posts stored in the '.drafts' directory.

Revise a published post stored in the article directory. After you're done

of the old title with the new one both. The filename will also
be changed.

View a published post stored in the article directory on your default browser.
Same with the -v option; the 'BROWSER' environmental variable has to be set
in order for this option to work.

the post from the articles' index file and the RSS feed.

.Sh PREPARATION
.Pp
Inside the
.Nm
script, edit the variables at the top of the file to match your own configuration.
.Pp
In case you don't edit the script further, the structure of your website's
directory should look like this:
.Pp
        ├── .drafts/
        |   └── unpublished articles live here
        ├── articles/
        |   └── articles live here
        ├── article_index.html
        ├── template.html
        └── rss.xml
.Pp
Inside 'article_index.html' (or whatever you name it) and 'rss.xml'
.Nm
will search for an <!--SBRS--> comment in order to put the article
listings and RSS feed below it.
.Pp
The 'template.html' file is an outline of the article page. Take a look
at the 'template.html' provided. The 'TITLE', 'HEADER' and 'AUTHOR'
get replaced by
.Nm .
.Sh USAGE
.Pp
You must always run
.Nm
inside the website's main directory. Only one option can be used at a time.
.Sh NOTES
Do NOT edit the various comments that the script writes inside the files,
otherwise it'll not work properly, or work at all.
