sbrs
====
A small and simple blog and RSS shell script written in POSIX shell.

Preparation
-----------
Inside the 'sbrs' script, change the 'WEBSITE' and 'AUTHOR' variables
to match your website's URL and your name.

In case you don't edit the script further, the structure of your
website's directory should look like this. The files below need
to exist with the same names.

        ├── blog
        |   └── here reside your blog posts
        ├── index.html
        ├── blog.html
        ├── template.html
        └── rss.xml

Inside 'index.html', 'blog.html' and 'rss.xml' sbrs will search for
<!--SBRS--> in order to put the blog post listings and RSS feed below it.

The 'template.html' file is how you want your blog post's page to look like.
See my own 'template.html' for more. The 'TITLE', 'HEADER' and 'AUTHOR'
fields must exist and be left as is.

Installation 
------------
sbrs will be installed in /usr/local/bin

        cd path/to/sbrs/
        sudo make install

Usage
-----
You must always run the script inside your website's main directory.
Run it with one of the following options. Only one option can be used
at a time.

Options:
  -n        New post
  -p        Publish draft post
  -e        Edit draft post
  -v        View draft post in browser
  -t        Delete draft post
  -r        Revise published post
  -c        Change title
  -o        View published post in browser
  -d        Delete published post
  -l        List all published posts

Notes:
------
Do NOT edit the various comments that the script writes inside the files,
otherwise it'll not work properly, or work at all.
